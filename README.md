# My profile
* 👋 Hi, I’m @PrelevatedInsider22581
* 👀 I’m interested in ASP.NET, .NET, React JS, HTML, CSS, JS and C#, WPF, Win32 API (C#), before WPF; I'm interested in WinForms
* 🧠 I now know some C/C++ because I wrote a Hello, World! program in my PC. I also know Win32 API because I first wrote it in C#, then I tested with C/C++. I've tried GetUserName, success! I also tried it in C/C++, also success!
